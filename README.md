# DataLab
DataLab is a visual data processing designer and a visual execution engine. 

Design data processing tasks visually as graph by using basic constructs Reader, Processor, Writer and Condition . These tasks can be executed and current progress would be shown visually.  

### Reader  
generate or fetch data from a data system ( Reader is the starting point and only one present for a task)

### Processor 
process or update given data by interacting with a data system 

### Writer

### Condition
